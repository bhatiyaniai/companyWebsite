          Deep learning has transformed computer vision by enabling machines to learn visual features automatically. Below is a concise overview of key architectures shaping the field in 2025.
        </p>
        <h2>From Hand-Crafted to Learned Features</h2>
        <p>
          Traditional computer vision relied on manually designed features, which struggled with complex, high-dimensional data. Deep learning replaces this with end-to-end neural networks that learn optimal representations directly from images, dramatically improving accuracy and flexibility.
        </p>
        <h2>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>ResNet:</b> Introduced residual connections to enable networks with dozens or hundreds of layers without vanishing gradients. ResNet-50 remains a popular backbone for tasks like object recognition and medical imaging.</li>
          <li><b>EfficientNet:</b> Uses compound scaling of depth, width, and resolution to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer parameters, ideal for real-time and edge deployments.</li>
          <li><b>Classic Variants:</b> VGG (simple, deep stacks of convolutions) and Inception (multi-branch filter modules) laid foundational design patterns still used today.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Vision Transformers (ViTs)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>ViT:</b> Treats image patches as tokens and applies self-attention to capture long-range dependencies. When trained on large datasets, ViTs rival or surpass CNNs.</li>
          <li><b>Swin Transformer:</b> Processes local image windows hierarchically, reducing computation and scaling effectively to high resolutions.</li>
          <li><b>DeiT & ConvNeXt:</b> DeiT integrates knowledge distillation for data-efficient training; ConvNeXt modernizes CNNs by borrowing transformer training practices, often achieving top accuracy.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Real-Time Object Detection</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>YOLO Series:</b> “You Only Look Once” models continuously evolve (v3 through v8), improving speed and accuracy for real-time detection by refining backbones, anchor designs, and loss functions.</li>
          <li><b>YOLOX:</b> Adopts anchor-free detection and a decoupled head for enhanced performance with simpler architecture.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Generative Models</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>GANs:</b> Generative Adversarial Networks pit a generator against a discriminator, producing realistic images and augmenting datasets without manual labeling.</li>
          <li><b>Diffusion Models:</b> Newer approaches like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 2 reverse a noise process to generate high-fidelity images, often conditioned on text via models like CLIP.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Multimodal and Self-Supervised Learning</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>CLIP:</b> Learns joint image–text embeddings, enabling zero-shot classification and retrieval without task-specific training.</li>
          <li><b>Self-Supervised Methods:</b> Drastically reduce the need for labeled data by learning from unannotated images, accelerating model development and deployment.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Emerging Trends</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Federated Learning:</b> Trains models across devices without sharing raw data, enhancing privacy in sensitive domains.</li>
          <li><b>Edge AI:</b> Advances in lightweight architectures enable real-time inference on mobile and embedded hardware.</li>
          <li><b>Ethics & Sustainability:</b> Growing focus on energy-efficient training and ethical AI practices to minimize environmental impact and bias.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Choosing the Right Model</h2>
        <p>Selection depends on dataset size, compute resources, latency requirements, and target application.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use EfficientNet or ConvNeXt for balanced accuracy and efficiency.</li>
          <li>Choose ViTs when ample data and compute are available.</li>
          <li>Opt for YOLO variants for real-time detection.</li>
          <li>Leverage GANs or Diffusion Models for creative generation and data augmentation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By understanding these architectures and their strengths, practitioners can select and tailor models to drive innovation across domains—from healthcare diagnostics to autonomous systems and creative applications.
